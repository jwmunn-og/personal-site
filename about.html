								<p class="intro">I&rsquo;m a De<span class="swash">s</span>igner, Front-End Developer &amp; Illustrator with a passion for building beautiful, functional websites.</p>
								<p>Welcome to my small corner of the interweb. I work with individuals, entreprenuers and small businesses to build brands and responsive websites. I&rsquo;m currently working remotely following my <a href="https://instagram.com/thensusansaid">lovely wife</a> around the country with our cross-eyed siamese cat <a href="http://instagram.com/chandler_cat">Chandler</a>. When I&rsquo;m not pushing pixels and lusting over ligatures, I can be found next to the nearest basket of buffalo wings or tinkering with sounds through my tube amp.</p>

								<p>This site is the 3rd iteration since it began in 2009. The first two versions were mainly static image heavy portfolios as I learned to code, this latest evolution is more personal. Openness is one of the things I love about the web community and this site will serve as a sandbox for experiments, thoughts and a bit of show and tell for everything I've been up to lately. It's the start of a journey to write more and contribute what I can to the community I've learned so much from.</p>
								<h3>Site Details</h3>
								<p>A product of thought, sweat, work &amp; learning over the last couple years. The site is responsive, hand written HTML/CSS and supercharged with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>, and by <a href="https://gridsetapp.com/">Gridset</a>.</p>
								<p>Typefaces are <strong>Bookmania</strong> and <strong>Proxima Nova Alt</strong>, both beautifully crafted by <a href="http://www.marksimonson.com/fonts">Mark Simonson</a>, &amp; served up in webfont form via <a href="http://www.webink.com/">WebIn<span class="swash">k</span></a>. Hosted by <a href="http://mediatemple.net/">(mt)</a>.</p>
